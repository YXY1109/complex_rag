## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Unified Model Provider Factory
The system SHALL provide a factory pattern for creating and managing different model providers.

#### Scenario: Provider instantiation
- **WHEN** a model provider is requested
- **THEN** the factory creates the appropriate provider based on configuration
- **AND** ensures consistent interface across all provider types

#### Scenario: Runtime provider switching
- **WHEN** configuration changes specify a different model provider
- **THEN** the factory creates new provider instances without service restart
- **AND** gracefully handles provider transitions

## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Standardized Provider Interface
The system SHALL provide consistent interfaces for all model providers (LLM, embedding, reranking).

#### Scenario: Provider interface consistency
- **WHEN** different model providers are used
- **THEN** they all implement the same base interface methods
- **AND** provide consistent error handling and response formats

## REMOVED Requirements
### Requirement: Separate OpenAI Provider Implementations
**Reason**: Multiple OpenAI provider files create duplication and maintenance issues
**Migration**: Consolidate into single provider with support for different OpenAI services

### Requirement: Separate Ollama Provider Implementations
**Reason**: Redundant Ollama providers for different model types
**Migration**: Single Ollama provider supporting all model types (LLM, embedding, reranking)

### Requirement: Provider-specific Configuration Formats
**Reason**: Each provider having different configuration formats creates complexity
**Migration**: Standardized configuration format with provider-specific sections
