## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Unified Web Framework Implementation
The system SHALL provide a single FastAPI-based web framework implementation for all HTTP services.

#### Scenario: Service consolidation
- **WHEN** the system starts up
- **THEN** only FastAPI services are initialized
- **AND** all Sanic-based services are deprecated and removed

#### Scenario: API endpoint migration
- **WHEN** existing Sanic endpoints are accessed
- **THEN** they return deprecation warnings with migration information
- **AND** redirect to equivalent FastAPI endpoints

## REMOVED Requirements
### Requirement: Sanic Web Framework Support
**Reason**: Redundant framework implementation increases maintenance overhead and creates consistency issues
**Migration**: All Sanic endpoints will be migrated to FastAPI equivalents with identical functionality

### Requirement: Dual Framework Support
**Reason**: Supporting both FastAPI and Sanic provides no additional value while increasing complexity
**Migration**: System will standardize on FastAPI for all web service implementations
