## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Standardized Vector Storage Interface
The system SHALL provide a single standardized interface for vector storage operations across all implementations.

#### Scenario: Vector store abstraction
- **WHEN** vector operations are performed
- **THEN** the unified interface handles routing to appropriate storage backend
- **AND** provides consistent API regardless of underlying storage technology

#### Scenario: Storage backend switching
- **WHEN** configuration specifies different vector storage
- **THEN** the same interface works without code changes
- **AND** data migration tools are provided for backend changes

## REMOVED Requirements
### Requirement: Multiple Vector Retriever Interfaces
**Reason**: Duplicate interfaces create confusion and maintenance overhead
**Migration**: All functionality consolidated into single retriever interface with inheritance for specific implementations

### Requirement: Vector Store Service Duplication
**Reason**: Multiple implementations of similar vector storage functionality
**Migration**: Keep the most comprehensive implementation and migrate others to use it

### Requirement: Redundant Vector Implementations
**Reason**: Similar vector storage code scattered across different modules
**Migration**: Consolidate into single implementation with configuration-driven behavior
