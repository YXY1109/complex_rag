## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Modular Docker Configuration
The system SHALL provide modular Docker Compose configurations with environment-specific overrides.

#### Scenario: Environment-specific deployment
- **WHEN** deploying to different environments
- **THEN** base docker-compose file is combined with environment-specific overrides
- **AND** service configurations are consistent across environments

#### Scenario: Service configuration consistency
- **WHEN** multiple Docker Compose files reference the same service
- **THEN** they use consistent port mappings and environment variables
- **AND** avoid configuration conflicts

## REMOVED Requirements
### Requirement: Multiple Docker Compose Files with Duplicate Configurations
**Reason**: Duplicate Milvus, Redis, and other service configurations across multiple files
**Migration**: Create base configuration with modular service-specific files

### Requirement: Inconsistent Environment Variable Naming
**Reason**: Different files use different variable names for the same configuration
**Migration**: Standardize all environment variable names across configurations

### Requirement: Scattered Service Configurations
**Reason**: Related service configurations spread across multiple files
**Migration**: Group related services in logical configuration modules
