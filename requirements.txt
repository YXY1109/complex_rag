# Complex RAG Project Dependencies
# This file is for compatibility with tools that don't support pyproject.toml yet
# For development, please use: uv sync --dev

# Core dependencies are managed in pyproject.toml
# Install with: uv sync
# Install with dev dependencies: uv sync --dev

# If you need to use pip directly, you can export requirements with:
# uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt

# For backward compatibility, the main dependencies are:
# fastapi>=0.115.0
# sanic>=23.0.0
# sqlalchemy>=2.0.0
# pymilvus>=2.5.0
# elasticsearch>=8.15.0
# redis>=5.0.0
# langchain>=0.3.0
# loguru>=0.7.0
# And many more - see pyproject.toml for complete list

# Development tools (also in pyproject.toml):
# black>=25.0.0
# isort>=6.0.0
# mypy>=1.15.0
# pytest>=8.3.0
# flake8>=7.1.0

# Recommendation: Use uv for modern Python package management
# Install uv: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/
# Setup: python scripts/setup.py
